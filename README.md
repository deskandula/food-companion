# hello, world!
My name is Destiny Frett and I am a technology startup founder from St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. 

Food Companion is a digital solution to food waste and inaccessibility I initially created as a passion project while in undergrad. 

Fast-forward 2 years and we recently completed our first accelerator with Accelerate VI, an accelerator program based out of the US Virgin Islands, and are
positioning ourselves to revolutionize the possibilities of sustainability and social good on web 3.0. 

You can see our pitch presentation from Accelerate VI's Demo Day event here: https://lnkd.in/eyTNdKn4.

# hello, world!
👩🏽‍💻 My name is Destiny Frett and I am a technology startup founder from St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. 

🍎 Food Companion is a an early-stage startup committed to eliminating food waste and inaccessibility.

🇦🇺 I initially created it as a passion project after being inspired by a similar project I created for an internship at a soup kitchen while studying abroad in Sydney, AUS 

⏩ Fast-forward 2 years and we recently completed our first accelerator with Accelerate VI, an accelerator program based out of the US Virgin Islands, and are
positioning ourselves to revolutionize the possibilities of sustainability and social good on web 3.0.

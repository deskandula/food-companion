# hello, world!
🍎 Food Companion is an early-stage startup committed to eliminating food waste and inaccessibility.

👩🏽‍💻 Our founder is Destiny Frett, a foodie-sustainable-techie from St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. 

🇦🇺 She initially created Food Companion as a passion project after being inspired by a similar project she developed while interning abroad at a soup kitchen in Sydney, AUS 

⏩ Fast-forward 2 years, we recently completed our first accelerator with Accelerate VI, an accelerator program based out of the US Virgin Islands, and are
positioning ourselves to revolutionize the possibilities of sustainability and social good on web 3.0. 

🐘🚀 You can see our pitch presentation from Accelerate VI's Demo Day event here: https://lnkd.in/eyTNdKn4.
